### Comments
The source code shows **a lot of for loops** and **doesn't seem efficient**, but anyway I got record high and low between 2005 and 2014.
Then, I got dates when the recode high and low temperatures were broken during 2015.
Also, the figure showed strange spikes duging summer and winter. I checked the raw data and it seems like data has these dates. I did not have time to figure out further.
